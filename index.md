## About Me
---
I am enrolled in the Ph.D. program at [CDS](http://cds.iisc.ac.in), [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in) and associated with [FLAME Lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), headed by [Dr. Konduri Aditya](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/). Currently, I am working on Asynchronous Numerical schemes for Partial Differential Equations. My research work includes the performance analysis of numerical methods such as Finite Volume, Finite Element and Discontinuous Galerkin and studying the effects of introducing asynchrony to them while performing parallel computations on massively parallel supercomputers. The aim is to develope scalable asynchronous PDE solvers.

My interest also lies in Pure Mathematics, especially areas related to Topology. I worked on a problem related to Topological Combinatorics during my M.Sc., where the objective was to derive the relations between betti numbers of simplicial complexes of graphs and their various kinds of products.

Apart from  research, my other interests include travelling, tekking and nature photography. I have always been fond of nature and its beauty and love to explore new places.

### Asynchronous Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes
The idea is to introduce asynchrony to the Discontinuous Galerkin schemes while doing time integration and analyse the stability, convergence and performance of the new formulation. And finally implement it in C++/Fortran to get a highly scalable DG solver for PDEs.

### DS 200 -  Research Methods
##### Module 4: Visulatization of datasets using Matplotlib
Data on faculties in IITs and LPG consumption in India for the years 2012-19 have been accessed from https://www.data.gov.in. And then using a python script we obtain bar plot and scatter plot for the first data and box plot for the second data to study the growth and other related factors. For further reference, please visit the respective [github repository](https://github.com/gshubhamk/ds200-module4).

### Homology Groups for Simplicial Complexes defined by Product Graphs and Joins 
The purpose of this project was to derive some relations between betti numbers of simplicial complexes of graphs and their products. It was a part of the final year M.Sc. Project in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA) at [IIT Kharagapur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in), where I was supervised by professor [Bibhas Adhikar](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA/faculty/ma-bibhas). We mainly worked on Corona products and Kronecker products of graphs and derived direct relations to obtain betti numbers of the products, provided we have all the informations about the graphs taking part in products. It makes the task of studying topological properties of big networks vey easy, assuming there are generation processes available to generate the big network using small ones.
