## About Me
---
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Ruhr University](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/), Bochum, Germany, working with [Dr. Martin Kronbichler](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fakultaet/arbeitsbereiche/numerik/gruppe-kronbichler/team/prof-dr-martin-kronbichler/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Konduri Aditya](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/) in the [FLAME Lab](https://flamelab-iisc.github.io/) at [CDS](http://cds.iisc.ac.in), [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in), in July 2024, where I worked on asynchronous numerical schemes for partial differential equations. My PhD research was focused on the development of novel asynchronous numerical schemes based on finite difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods, analyzing their numerical properties and demonstrating scalability on massively parallel supercomputers. The objective of my PhD thesis was to develop a highly scalable DG-based PDE solver for massively parallel flow simulations. 

Apart from research, my other interests are traveling and trekking, and I love exploring new places.

### Asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method
The objective of this work was to introduce an asynchronous computing approach to the discontinuous Galerkin method by relaxing communication/synchronization at a mathematical level while solving time-dependent partial differential equations in a distributed memory setting, analyze the numerical properties of the new formulation, and demonstrate its scalability. The final goal was to develop a highly scalable DG-based PDE solver for massively parallel supercomputers within the open-source finite element library deal.II.

<!--### DS 200 -  Research Methods
##### Module 4: Visualization of datasets using Matplotlib
Data on faculties in IITs and LPG consumption in India for the years 2012-19 have been accessed from https://www.data.gov.in. And then, using a Python script, we obtain a bar plot and scatter plot for the first data and a box plot for the second data to study the growth and other related factors. For further reference, please visit the respective [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gshubhamk/ds200-module4).

### Homology groups for simplicial complexes defined by product graphs and joins 
The purpose of this project was to derive relations between betti numbers of simplicial complexes of graphs and their products. It was a part of the final year M.Sc. Project in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA) at [IIT Kharagapur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in), where I was supervised by professor [Bibhas Adhikari](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA/faculty/ma-bibhas). We mainly worked on Corona products and Kronecker products of graphs and derived direct relations to obtain betti numbers of the products, provided we have all the information about the graphs taking part in products. It makes the task of studying the topological properties of big networks very easy, assuming there are generation processes available to generate the big network using small ones.
