## About Me
---
I am a part of [FLAME lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/) at [CDS](https://cds.iisc.ac.in), [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in) since August 2019, working with [Dr. Konduri Aditya](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/) on Asynchronous schemes for Partial Differential Equations. My research work includes the performance analysis of numerical methods such as Finite Volume, Finite Element and Discontinuous Galerkin and effects of introducing asynchrony to them while performing parallel computations on massively parallel supercomputers. The aim is to develope scalable asynchronous PDE solvers.

My interest also lies in Pure Mathematics, especially areas related to Topology. I worked on Topological Combinatorics during my M.Sc., where the problem was to derive the relations between betti numbers of simplicial complexes of graphs and their various kinds of products.

Apart from  research, my other interests include travelling, tekking and nature photography. I have always been fond of nature and its beauty and love to explore new places.

### Projects 

[Asynchronous Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes](https://github.com/gshubhamk/dg1d)
The idea is to introduce asynchrony to the Discontinuous Galerkin schemes during time integration and analyse the stability, convergence and performance of the new formulation. Finally, we plan to have a highly scalabale DG solver for PDEs.
